Goal: We want our user to be able to authenticate
Endgame: have a token in our app (probably in the store)

- Get the credentials from the user (login form) X
- POST to authentication route (THUNK), returns our token X
* use the me endpoint to get some information about the user
- Store it in the store X
- Get the user information using '/me'
- Make authenticated request by putting the token in the header
